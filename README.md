# Competitive Positioning Matrix  
**Understanding Strategic Placement Through Reach and Value**

---

## Problem

In a competitive landscape, it’s not enough to simply operate at scale — companies must also deliver perceived value to customers in order to build loyalty and defend market share. The challenge lies in understanding not only **where a company stands** compared to others, but **why** it stands there — and what can be done to move it.

## Process

This project uses a **simulated dataset** to analyze and visualize competitive positioning through two core dimensions:

- **Market Reach** — a composite of product count, global presence, revenue, and price accessibility
- **Perceived Value** — a composite of NPS score, brand buzz, and customer experience rating

Steps:
1. Generate and clean data
2. Engineer normalized features
3. Build two strategic dimensions
4. Visualize results using a 2D positioning matrix and ranked comparison chart

## Insight

**My Company is ranked just below the midpoint of the market.** While our **Perceived Value ranks in the top third (8th–9th of 27)**, our **Market Reach is much lower (21st–22nd)**. This indicates we are delivering strong value, but not reaching a wide enough audience.

## Final Recommendation

To break into the **top 5 strategic performers**, we recommend a **resource allocation shift** toward scaling reach while maintaining existing value strength.

### Resource Allocation: **70% Reach / 30% Value**
- **Reach Priorities:**
  - Expand distribution and exposure
  - Broaden product access or market footprint
  - Increase visibility through brand and marketing investment

- **Value Maintenance:**
  - Preserve customer experience (CX)
  - Maintain loyalty and advocacy (NPS)

> Closing this reach gap while maintaining value could position us for a **Top 5 strategic ranking within the next few years**.
